        <p3>How to Lose weight the Right way--</p3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p align =left>1) diet:</p>
        <p>Choosing the right diet model can be confusing for anyone whose just beginning their weight loss journey, but here ill try to make it the MOST basic for you.
        <br> Heres a quick lesson about your internal biology: In you is a self regulating system called your Metabolism that converts food you eat into energy for survival.
        <br>This system is basically responsible for how your body burns a crap ton of short term cals or in other words body fat(the conversion is 3500 cals per lb).<br>
        In order to be able to lose weight, youll have to calculate your metabolism using this calculator: 
        <a href="https://www.active.com/fitness/calculators/bmr">Calculate your metabolism here.</a><br>
    </div>
    <div class= "size" >
        So now how do we lose weight?<br>
    </div>
        Answer: GO ON A CALORIE DEFICIT. 
        <div class=white>
        <br>According to a medical article," A calorie deficit occurs when the number of calories a person consumes in a day is smaller than the number of calories they burn."
        <br> In dummies terms it means eat less food(calories) than your normal metabolic rate or what you usually would eat. For example: if my metabolism is 2500(meaning i could eat about 3-4 moderate meals a day on avg).<br>
        Then I would reduce the number of calories Im eating below my metabolism of 2500.<br>
        Its crucial to set healthy goals and not starve yourself. For reference I would try to go below 500 cals from your metabolism by cutting high calorie foods. Thus, i will be in a caloric defficient state wherein I hopefully you too will lose weight.

        <br>Foods for choice:<br>
    </div>
    <div class=white>
        EAT LOW CALORIE FOODS.<br>
        Its still shocking how people think theres a magic pill, fancy diet, or magical way to come down from obesity.<br>
        The reality though is quiet simpler than what anyone believes.<br>
        you dont actually have to starve yourself on an intermitten fasting, water fasting, ketogenic, or atkins diet to be able to get shredded, lean, or healthy...(facepalm insert)
    </div>
        <br>
        <div class=underline>
        All you need to do is eat LOW calorie Dense Foods.<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="size"> What are examples of those foods???? <br></div>
    <div class=white>
        Theres absolutely no restriction when it comes to recipe building. you just have to be mindful of the calories you are consuming and track them everyday on a cal counter. 
        This will help you realize the weight changes you have achieved and you will experience higher motivation from being consistent.
        <br> One often hugely overlooked detail about foods are the macro nutrients you are getting. Make sure for the love of god you are getting all different kinds of nutrients(proteins in meats, fish, eggwhites, supps; fibers in fruits and vegetables;sugar in 0 calorie drinks or artificial sweetners and add normal sugar too for your insulin to normalize; and EAT CARBS just not in high amounts )
        <br> The point is dont leave out foods that you cant live without- include some snacks, but just dont put them infront of your sight- hide them in your car for later. 
        Some of the best foods I recommend for going on calorie deficitsare
        <br>[egg whites, lots of fruits, low calorie substitutes for high calorie foods, protein supplements, breakfasts like french toast or pancakes(dont be a carbaphobe), tons of meats, and lots of vegetables are several among many more!].

        <br>
        <div class ="white">
        <div class=eggs></div>
        1)Egg whites: Eat them instead of eggs with the yolk!!! You will be able to eat way less calories and have bigger portions, thus remaining fuller. Also, they are a greater source of pure protein that goes well with everything including low cal pastries, toast, and cake.

    Everyone can lose weight. I sucked at it for my entire life until i started tracking my calories and eating below my maintance level metabolism. I learned from various confusing sources that had conflicting information, which was partially good and harmful. But after all those years of watching on the sidelines I  finally applied the caloric deficit method without giving up, or actually losing my mind over hunger just because I was actually satiating my appetite with tons of low calorie foods. I still ate what I loved, mexican food monthly, tons of juicy fruits like berries, and I even found replacements for fatty candy bars like protein bars or the fake sugar they put into lower calorie snacks. Eventhough they arent the real thing, its still better than starving, and being at dangeours levels of malnurishment. We should feel good about what we eat, not depressed, and take up eating disorders to fuel our obsessions with radical weight loss. I will admit that its possible to lose loads of pounds in a few months like over 50, but this comes at an unhealthy cost that you shouldnt take. Follow this guide and you will lose cals the same way but better backed by science and pofessional ifbb body builders who know what the fk they are saying.
