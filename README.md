A website with basic UI elements. Not built with any fancy front end apps like React, or AZURE etc. The focus of the website is to publish my own works including, games, music software, weight loss programs, and a live server to display fresh new data coming in. 
This website is built on JS, and basic styles. It has a bit of backend server development from PHP and SQL webserver. Lastly, there are lots of projects yet to be accomplished in the coming future.
